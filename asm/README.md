# ASM
This uses tools by Christopher "Kerm Martian" Mitchell at Cemetech to compile asm programs into .8xps

## Assembling your source code

To use the included tools, extract the doorsCS sdk and enter the folder. Put your asm source in the ```source``` folder, and compile your program with the "compile" shell script or batch fille.

### Windows
```./compile.bat mySource.asm```

### Linux
```./compile.sh mySource.asm```


Note: using the shell script, you will need the mono runtime.
