# ASM
This uses tools by Christopher "Kerm Martian" Mitchell at Cemetech to compile asm programs into .8xps

To use it, extract the doorsCS sdk and enter the folder. Put your asm source in the ```source``` folder, and compile your program with the "compile" shell script or batch fille.

## Windows
```./compile.bat mySource.asm```

## Linux
```./compile.sh mySource.asm```


Note: using the shell script, you will need the mono runtime.
